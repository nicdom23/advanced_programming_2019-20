WE have to implement a lot of vlasses which sare some data:how to avoius code duplication??
open 00_first_trial.c
make a struct animal that inherits all the info
If i have to descrube with words the oop i would use
IS A
HAS A   -> Object composition define a class and put a member of that type
USE A
what is a snake? Is a

open 01 Inheritance.cc
Struct dog:public animal{} DOG IS AN ANIMAL
IS A -> public inheritance
inheriths functions and variables

public protected private
protected
public: visible from outside:dog accesses public member of animal
animal is a base class: parent class or superclass
dog is a child class,or derived class can be represented with a graph

protected means that from ooutside is just private, but children can access protected data
USE A private and protected
protected--public becomes protected  become implementation details
std vector inherits from a class that handles allocation and deallocation

intern inherits a person:will always remain an intern::::you cannot implement an activity::: implement class activity


open 02_virtual.cc  each children implements its own functions: use virtual private word 


If this object has size zero you could fit many a t once

size of a struct is one byte, even an empty inherited class
virtual:children can reimplement the function
now with size 8 added virtual function table:::added a pointer to a table that will consider when everytime a new children is inserted has one row per type of the children::contains pointer to the derived functions like foo::bar()  derived::bar() ::: will acces one row of the table and will access the function..
dicciculty, greater object, and jumping in memory,function cannot be inlined, jump anyway:::::lot of jumps::for HPC no virtual functions, too many jumps::no virtual functions    dinamic binding calls virtual functions


polimorphism pass a child at the class that asks for a parent


override with virtual
overload same function name, different arguments

how to overwrite virtual functions?  positiional keyword override

virtual fucntions means that class must be inherithed

THERE IS a BUG(NOW it has a virtual destructor)

open 03_virtual_destructor.cc
huge leak, no destructor::::: virtual destructor solves the problem

RUNTIME PENALTIES WITH The USE OF VIRTUAL

open 04_private.cc

class animal


using can be templated


runtime polimorphism versus templates
