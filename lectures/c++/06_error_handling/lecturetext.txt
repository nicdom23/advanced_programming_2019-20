ERROR Are exceptional events Error handling is not an easy topic
On modern professianola librarues 50%is herror handling. If yoy develo p a libraty yo may knoww ehy something is not good.he knows what escepton may occur from where and ehat do they do. You dont know what to do. 
Error handling is event specific a certain event hapened. what to do if exception occurs somewhere in the world

Return 0 measn no error
return value might be an error handling. the user should check the return type. what if a function returnd ssomething by design.
fucntion sqrt returns sqroot of a number, if something went wrong i cannot
run 00

The program doesnt crash, you get a NaN, which alwas returns Nan always..use function Isnan


THrer is the macro

inside catch clauses you write what happened, you only see that an error happened. the explanations are something to be written inside the ball, i see a message inside

next>>

next >>assert to remaove the clauses If the condition is true ecertything is fine 
else the program crashes <<<>>>exception in C++

The result is an abort becasue you dont get excetuin ig you compile code with esxetiof .DNDEBUG 
and i run it and i insert -8 no wìexcetoui is throen+

asserts are executed except you have -DNDEBUG  

chechs can be turnd on and off, off the code is faster, the code is slower except, you turn off the checks and get a faster code with DNDEBug



>>an exception is thrown we do stack unwinding calls the destructor for all objects that executed well

After the catch close: no memory leaks>> ihave to release the memory everytime i cathc i restart the program,,you have to always clean the memory

delete 


MAIN(){
try{}


catch{}

}
>>how we shoud define macros about error handling

macro elaborated by the preprocessorù
define a macro name of the m,acro, optional arguments, what the preprocessors will substiture whrn you call the macro,, continuation line char \\\  
}
