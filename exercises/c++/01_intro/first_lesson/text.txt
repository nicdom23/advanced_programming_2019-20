c++ is a compiled language, needs a compiler, its our friend it tells programming errors

use the makefile with make to compile the programs

open emacs first.cc

different compilers give us different performances

compile with c++ or gcc or clang++

modify the code and recompile it

? is a variable that memorizes the last output from the last program
access it using echo $? and check the output of the executable		
   			made by c++ -S								
compilation includes several steps :  SRC --> PreProcessor--> Assembly .s (last level that is human readable)--> object file .o  ---> linking with other files to get the executable
		can be made with c++ -c  		then we do c++ file.o to get the executable

Use semicolons

we start by variable.cc  variables are entities of particular types  int double char bool
//C++ is a static language every variable needs a type

new way to define variables int a{-1}
Private words cant be used as variables, variables can't start with numbers
Different type occupy different sizes of memory
4 concepts type value object variable

##object is a set of bytes
##the value of those bits defines the value of the object
##each object has a type: a type tells us how to interpret the object and what to do with it
## a variable is a named object

c++ is strongly checked (Type integrity is verified during compilation)

const -> we wont change the value
constexpr -> knowing that an expression is constant gives us a better performance during the compilation, because it is calculated during the compilation

Open hello_name.cc   >> are called stream
Open loops.cc
 for{::} endless loop
if the body of a for loop is one instruction then {} can be omitted
i is out of scope outside the for loop
int i{} => i defined as a i=0 TRY THIS STATEMENT

while loop
do while executes the do statement at least once

break(exit from the innermost loop and continue(go to the next iteration

open watch_out.cc    we experience an overflow where the one bit is shifted to the left and represents the biggest negative number possible, this happened on arian 5

never use == or != with floating points number  --> infinite loop

setprecision sets how many digits are printed
0.1 cannot  be expressed correctly so 0.1*10 is not equal to 1
if we have to compare two floating point numbers
include cmath

then use 
double d1,d2
std::abs(d1-d2)<1e-15

Open pointers.cc

double d = 9.9
double &ref = d; ref is an alias of d!!
double *ptr = &d; ptr and &d is an adress pointing at d 
		ptr is interpreted as an adress pointing at d
		the value of pointers is the same adress of d
*p access to d dereferenciation of the pointer

open functions.cc
c++ functions accept references
